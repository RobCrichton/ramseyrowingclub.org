# Water Safety Policy
> Last reviewed 11th November, 2014.

## 1. Duty of Care
A Duty of Care requires us to consider that the consequences of our acts or omissions do not give rise to a foreseeable risk of injury to any other person.

All members of Ramsey Rowing Club owe each other a duty of care.

In addition as an organisation Ramsey Rowing Club owes a Duty of Care to members of the public we encounter through the pursuit of our activities.

It is important that we all understand and accept our responsibilities to operate as safely as possible. Those members who act in such a way as to deliberately endanger the wellbeing of others will be in breach of their Duty of Care and may be asked to withdraw from the activities of the organisation.

Having carried out a risk assessment of our activities, Ramsey Rowing Club has drawn up a safety code of practice. It is important that all members familiarise themselves with this code of practice and adhere to the procedures laid down.

Please be aware that we will not be expected to be ‘expert’ in any particular field neither would we be expected to guarantee the safety of others. Specific Skills, knowledge and experience used in a reasonable manner is sufficient.

Within our duty of care a Safety Audit will be completed annually and submitted to British Rowing.

## 2. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to provide members of the Ramsey Rowing Club with information required in order to be safe when participating in rowing activities.

The club aims to attract a wide range of people in terms of rowing expertise and experience and to provide a sufficient level of coaching/supervision to enable enjoyment and development of individual rowers.

These procedures and adherence to them is to protect and support all levels of the Ramsey Rowing Club from litigation. However in the event of deliberate and reckless actions causing injury to another person, negligence is likely to be cited.

The regular monitoring and evaluation process that is part of the continually developing safety programme, will continue to help eliminate or manage the foreseeable risks and avoid negligence.

CWSA/ Captain can exclude people from rowing if they were deemed not to be competent for the prevailing conditions.

There will be a first aid qualified person present at each outing.

There must be a comprehensive fully equipped first aid kit, thermal blankets and an emergency lifeline. (see appendix i)

The CWSA will regularly replenish the first aid kit.

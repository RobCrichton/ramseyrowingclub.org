# FAQs
## How does the group work?
We have a regular weekly outing (on the water) and additional land-based training sessions to help with fitness and to get more out of the outings.

## Can anyone join?
Any adult of any age who wants to row, and can swim 100 Metres clothed, have no medical or physical condition that would prevent them from taking part in heavy exercise can row with us. We welcome all new members and invite anyone who wishes to try it out to contact us whether it is for sport and fitness or just as a recreational leisure activity. All you need to start is an old pair of training shoes and sport kit. Bear in mind that you may get wet, so you will need to bring a change of clothes.

We are sorry, but at present we are unable to take under 16’s as members, although it is our intention to qualify the club to be able do this as soon as possible.

## How much does it cost?
You are welcome to come along and try a couple of sessions before joining up.

## Do you go out in any weather?
Almost … we don’t go out if there is lightning or the water is very choppy or in very high winds. Coastal rowing is tidal; there are some tide conditions that are very difficult when you first start, so we might avoid those. However, if we can’t go out on the sea, we will do a session on the Mooragh lake.

## What should I wear and bring along?
You should stick to clothes that are close fitting (loose clothes tend to get in the way) and plenty of layers. It is advisable to bring an old pair of trainers that you don’t mind getting wet, or alternatively a pair of wet boots (dive boots). It’s also worth bringing a change of clothes and towel for afterwards. A bottle of water is advisable. It is also recommended that you bring a hat, sunglasses and sun cream for the sunnier days and a woolly hat for the colder ones.

## Do I need gloves to row?
You don’t need gloves, but this is a personal preference. However, it is suggested that if you choose to wear gloves that you use a light type of glove (like a cycle glove, usually fingerless).

## Will I get wet?
If it’s raining then yes, otherwise not really. You may get splashed as people around you are rowing, but you are very unlikely to be going swimming.

## What other training will I need to do?
That’s up to you. If you’re keen to progress quickly then land training will help you to get more out of the water sessions, but it’s not mandatory as a beginner. Initially, we recommend doing one erg (rowing machine session) when you can at your local gym.

## Is there a beginners course?
This isn’t a specific course. When you’re ready, we’ll move you up to the main squads and get you racing (which is the really fun part). The time this takes will depend on you and also on finding a suitable time to start you off in the main squad. For more information or to sign up, please “contact us” link to club’s captain who is always on hand to answer all your rowing questions.

## Can anyone row?
This form is adapted from the PAR-Q developed by the Exercise Association of England. If you are over 59 years of age, and you are not used to being very active, check with your doctor before you start rowing.

If you are between the ages of 18 and 59 the questionnaire will tell you if you should check with your doctor before you start rowing. All information supplied will be held in confidence by the Club.

1. Are you unable to swim more than 100 metres?
2. Has your doctor ever said that you have a heart condition and that you should only do physical activity recommended by a doctor?
3. Do you ever feel pain in your chest when you do physical activity?
4. Have you ever had chest pain when you are not doing physical activity?
5. Do you ever feel faint or have spells of dizziness?
6. Do you have a joint problem that could be made worse by exercise?
7. Have you ever been told that you have high blood pressure?
8. Are you currently taking any medication of which your coach should be made aware?
9. Are you pregnant, or have you had a baby in the last six months?
10. Do you know of any other reason why you should not participate in physical act

If you have answered yes to one or more questions, talk with your doctor by phone or in person before you start rowing.

Tell your doctor about the questionnaire and to which questions you have answered yes. You may be able to start rowing as long as you start slowly and build up gradually. Follow the advice given to you. If you have answered no to all questions: you can be reasonably sure that you can start rowing.

Begin slowly and build up gradually. If you feel any pain or discomfort at any stage bring this to the attention of your coach.

**DO NOT EVER SUFFER IN SILENCE!**

If you feel unwell because of temporary illness such as cold or fever – wait until you are better. If your health changes so that you subsequently answer yes to any of the questions above consult your doctor immediately.

## Do I have to complete any forms when I arrive?
You will be required to sign a waiver form when you attend for your first rowing session.

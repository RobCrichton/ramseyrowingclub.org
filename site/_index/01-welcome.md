Ramsey Rowing Club is the only rowing club in the Isle of Man.

We row from the Mooragh Promenade on Ramsey north beach and on the Mooragh park lake.

We provide a fun atmosphere for recreational rowing and sculling and are open to all ages and sections of the community.

We are an affiliated member of British Rowing, the governing body for the sport of rowing in the UK.

We welcome new members from complete beginners to experienced veterans, if you are interested in learning more about joining Ramsey Rowing Club please click on “I want to be a Ramsey Rower” for more information.
